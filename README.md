## Project Overview

The Road Accident Dashboard Analysis is designed to present an in-depth analysis of road accident data. The dashboard highlights key metrics such as total casualties, casualties by vehicle type, and various road conditions. This analysis aims to identify patterns and trends in road accidents to support initiatives aimed at reducing fatalities and improving road safety.

## Data Sources

The data used in this dashboard has been sourced from reliable traffic authorities and accident databases. It includes detailed records of road accidents from the years 2021 and 2022.

## Dashboard Overview

The dashboard provides a snapshot of the road accident scenario with a total casualty count of **417,883**. Below is a breakdown of the various components of the dashboard:

### Total Casualties

- **Fatal Casualties**: The number of fatal casualties is **7,135**, accounting for **1.7%** of the total casualties.
- **Serious Casualties**: There are **59,312** serious casualties, representing **14.2%** of the total casualties.
- **Slight Casualties**: A majority of the casualties are slight, with a count of **351,436**, making up **84.1%** of the total.

### Casualties by Vehicle Type

The breakdown of casualties by vehicle type reveals that:

- **Cars**: The highest number of casualties, **333,485** (approximately **79.8%** of total casualties), involve cars.
- **Buses**: There are **12,798** casualties involving buses.
- **Vans**: Vans are involved in **33,472** casualties.
- **Motorcycles**: Motorcycle-related casualties stand at **33,672**.
- **Cyclists**: Cyclist casualties amount to **1,032**.
- **Others**: **3,424** casualties are attributed to other vehicle types.

### Yearly Casualties Trend

The dashboard presents a comparison of the monthly trend for casualties between 2021 and 2022:

- There is a consistent increase in casualties from January to November, with a slight drop observed in December for 2022.
- The trend line shows that 2022 had slightly higher casualties compared to 2021, suggesting a rising trend in road accidents.

### Casualties by Road Type

The distribution of casualties by road type is as follows:

- **Single Carriageway**: The majority of casualties occur on single carriageways, with **309.7k** incidents.
- **Dual Carriageway**: There are **67.4k** casualties on dual carriageways.
- **Roundabouts**: **26.8k** casualties occur at roundabouts.
- **One Way Street**: **7.4k** casualties are reported on one-way streets.
- **Slip Road**: Slip roads account for **4.7k** casualties.

### Casualties by Road Surface

The dashboard also segments casualties based on road surface conditions:

- **Dry**: A significant number of casualties, **279,445**, occur on dry roads.
- **Damp**: **115,261** casualties are recorded on damp road surfaces.
- **Snow/Ice**: Snowy or icy roads are associated with a smaller number of casualties.

### Casualties by Location

Casualties are distributed across rural and urban locations as follows:

- **Urban Areas**: Urban areas have a higher casualty count with **255.9k** incidents.
- **Rural Areas**: Rural areas account for **162.0k** casualties.

### Casualties by Light Condition

The impact of light conditions on road casualties is significant:

- **Daylight**: The majority of casualties, **305.0k**, occur during daylight.
- **Dark**: **112.9k** casualties are reported during dark conditions, highlighting the increased risk associated with poor visibility.

## Filter Panel

The filter panel allows users to interact with the dashboard by filtering data based on:

- **Accident Date**: Users can filter by specific quarters from 2022 to 2023 to analyze trends over time.
- **Urban or Rural**: This filter helps in analyzing the distribution of casualties between rural and urban areas.

## Recommendations

Based on the analysis presented in the dashboard, the following recommendations are proposed:

1. **Enhanced Road Safety Measures**: There is a need for targeted road safety campaigns, especially focusing on single carriageways and urban areas where the majority of casualties occur.
2. **Improved Lighting Conditions**: Since a significant number of casualties occur during dark conditions, improving street lighting in high-risk areas could reduce accidents.
3. **Vehicle Safety Initiatives**: Given that cars are involved in the majority of accidents, promoting vehicle safety technologies such as automatic braking systems could help mitigate casualties.

## Conclusion

The Road Accident Dashboard Analysis provides critical insights into the factors contributing to road accidents. By understanding the trends and distributions of casualties, stakeholders can implement more effective road safety measures. The dashboard highlights the areas of greatest concern, such as single carriageways and urban areas, offering a data-driven approach to improving road safety.

## Future Work

Moving forward, this project could be expanded to include:

- **Predictive Analysis**: Using machine learning models to predict future accident trends based on historical data.
- **Integration with Real-Time Data**: Incorporating real-time traffic data to update the dashboard dynamically, offering real-time insights for road safety management.
- **Detailed Regional Analysis**: A deeper dive into specific regions could provide more granular insights, helping to tailor interventions more effectively.
